BUGS:
- First time starting the script you may get error from res_rc_rc.py for some reason the QT standalone app saved my .qrc for PySide6 and I was using PyQt6 at the time.
When error occurs just manually edit the import inside the res_rc_rc.py set PyQt6 instead of PySide6 save the file and the program should run.
- There is an output from QT when program runs saying (Unknown property background-size) possibly cause I needed to override some things in QT
to make front end look better and there was no other way.

Bugs doesn't have effect on application stability!

FIXES:
- Added multiprocessing for plant population
- Made the code more modular for future development
- Cleaned a lot of stuff that wasn't useful in repository (I am a noob with git lol)
